I compare it with the current hospital prescriptions, identify discrepancies, and clarify them with the physician or pharmacist. Accurate reconciliation prevents omissions, duplications, or interactions.",

            a: 'I strictly follow the "five rights" of medication administration, double-check high-alert drugs with another nurse, clarify unclear orders, and use barcode scanning if available. I never rush, I minimize distractions during preparation, and I always document immediately after administration.',

After hand hygiene, I select an appropriate vein, apply a tourniquet, clean the site with antiseptic, and insert the cannula using aseptic technique. Once flashback is seen, I advance the catheter, release the tourniquet, secure the site, and flush with saline to confirm patency.",
