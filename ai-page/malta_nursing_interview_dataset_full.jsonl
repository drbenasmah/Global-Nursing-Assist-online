{"prompt": "What do you check on a post-op patient?", "completion": "On a post-operative patient, I would check vital signs (T, P, R, BP, SpO\u2082), wound site for bleeding or infection, drain outputs, IV line patency, pain level using an appropriate scale, urine output, level of consciousness, and signs of complications such as DVT or respiratory distress. I would document all findings and escalate any abnormalities."}
{"prompt": "How do you confirm an NG tube is in the stomach?", "completion": "I would confirm NG tube placement by aspirating gastric contents and testing the pH, which should typically be acidic (pH 1\u20135.5). If in doubt, or as per policy, I would confirm placement with a chest X-ray before commencing feeding or medications."}
{"prompt": "What would you do for an unconscious diabetic?", "completion": "I would first check the patient's responsiveness and airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC). I would check their blood glucose level. If hypoglycemia is suspected and IV access is available, I would prepare to assist with administration of IV dextrose as per hospital protocol. If IV access is unavailable, I would be ready to assist with IM glucagon. I would call for senior help immediately and monitor the patient closely."}
{"prompt": "What are the 4 types of injections?", "completion": "The four types of injections are: intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous. Each type has specific sites, techniques, and indications."}
{"prompt": "How do you administer medication through a central line?", "completion": "I would follow strict aseptic technique, wash hands, don gloves, and disinfect the access port. I would flush the line with normal saline, administer the medication slowly as prescribed, flush again, and document the procedure. I would monitor the patient for any adverse reactions."}
{"prompt": "How would you respond to a fall in the ward?", "completion": "I would ensure the patient's safety first, assess for injury without moving them unnecessarily, call for assistance, check vital signs, and provide first aid as needed. I would inform the medical team, document the incident, and complete an incident report as per policy."}
{"prompt": "How do you manage an aggressive or confused patient?", "completion": "I would ensure my safety and that of others, maintain a calm and non-threatening approach, use clear and simple communication, and try to identify the cause of aggression (e.g., pain, confusion, fear). I would seek help from colleagues and follow de-escalation protocols. If necessary, I would escalate to the medical team."}
{"prompt": "How do you administer IV meds bolus to a patient on normal saline?", "completion": "I would verify the prescription and the five rights of medication. I would perform hand hygiene, don gloves, clean the access port, stop the infusion temporarily, flush with saline, administer the medication slowly over the prescribed time, flush again, restart the infusion, and monitor the patient for adverse reactions."}
{"prompt": "What are the signs of catheter site inflammation and what would you do?", "completion": "Signs include redness, swelling, pain, warmth, and possible discharge at the site. I would stop using the catheter, inform the medical team, monitor for systemic infection, and document the findings. I would assist in removing or replacing the catheter if ordered."}
{"prompt": "What are MRSA and CRE? How do you prevent their spread in a hospital?", "completion": "MRSA is Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and CRE is Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Both are multidrug-resistant organisms. Prevention includes strict hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, patient isolation when necessary, environmental cleaning, and adherence to infection control policies."}
