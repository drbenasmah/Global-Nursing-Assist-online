                The first step in getting your foreign qualifications recognized
                can seem daunting, but based on my recent experience, it might
                be much faster and easier than you think.
              </p>
              
              <p>My name is Ben Asmah, a nursing graduate from an EU university and the founder of <strong>Nursing School Assist PL</strong> – a coaching platform supporting international nursing students in Poland and across Europe. I recently completed the Maltese registration process and want to share everything I learned to help you avoid the mistakes I made.</p>


              <h2>What is MQRIC and Why Do You Need It?</h2>
              <p>
                MQRIC stands for the Malta Qualifications Recognition
                Information Centre. It's the official body that evaluates
                foreign qualifications and issues a statement on how they
                compare to the Malta Qualifications Framework (MQF).
              </p>
              <p>
                For nurses applying to the Maltese Council for Nurses and
                Midwives, obtaining this statement is a mandatory first step.
                The Council's guidelines state that it is the applicant's
                responsibility "to produce a recognition statement on
                comparability of qualifications issued by the Malta
                Qualifications Recognition Information Centre (MQRIC)". Your
                qualification must be rated as at least
                <strong>MQF Level 5</strong> to be considered valid.
              </p>

              <h2>The Quick and Easy Path: My Experience with an EU Degree</h2>
              <p>
                The best part of my experience was discovering that for many
                qualifications obtained within the EU, the process is
                streamlined through an automatic recognition system. Because my
                university,
                <strong>Wyższa Szkoła Gospodarki in Poland</strong>, and my
                degree were already in their database, the process was
                incredibly fast and straightforward.
              </p>

              <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Getting Your MQRIC Statement</h2>

              <h3>
                Step 1: Visit the Official Portal and Find the Application Link
              </h3>
              <p>
                Everything starts on the Malta Further & Higher Education
                Authority (MFHEA) website. Here is the link to begin:
              </p>
              <p>
                <a
                  href="https://mfhea.mt/academic-qualifications/"
                  target="_blank"
                  >https://mfhea.mt/academic-qualifications/</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Once on the page, scroll down and click on the "Apply Here"
                button to start the process.
              </p>
              <img
                src="./blog-img/mquiric-img/apply here.png"
                alt="Modern laptop showing government website interface"
                class="post-content-image"
              />

              <h3>Step 2: Register and Enter Your Details</h3>
              <p>This is a two-part step:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  First, you will fill in your personal information to register
                  on the portal. When asked, "Why is the statement required?",
                  you should choose the option:
                  <strong>"I want to apply for promotion/Job"</strong>. Then
                  click 'Next'.
                </li>
                <img
                src="./blog-img/mquiric-img/register.png"
                alt="Modern laptop showing government website interface"
                class="post-content-image"
              />
                <li>
                  Next, you will provide your qualification details. Select your
                  country of study (e.g., Poland), the name of your awarding
                  institution (e.g., Wyższa Szkoła Gospodarki), and the title of
                  your qualification from the dropdown lists.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                <strong>Important Note:</strong>  If your university is in the dropdown list, your next steps are simple: click on add, check the confirm box, and move on to payment.  You do not need to upload your degree or transcript. Document uploads are only required if your institution is not listed.
              </p>
              <img
                src="./blog-img/mquiric-img/uni dropdown.png"
                alt="Professional working on laptop with forms and documents"
                class="post-content-image"
              />

              <h3>Step 3: Pay the Fee</h3>
              <p>
                The process requires a small fee. Based on my experience, the
                fee for a qualification already in the database was
                <strong>€15</strong>. You can pay this directly on the portal.
              </p>
              <img
                src="./blog-img/mquiric-img/payment.png"
                alt="Secure online payment interface on mobile device"
                class="post-content-image"
              />

              <h3>Step 4: Receive Your Statement Instantly</h3>
              <p>
                Because my qualification was recognized automatically, I
                received my official statement via email in about
                <strong>10 minutes</strong>. It was a PDF document, ready to be
                saved for the next stage of my application.
              </p>

              <h2>What Your MQRIC Statement Looks Like</h2>
              <p>
                The final document is a formal statement of comparability. My
                own statement included:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>A unique reference number (e.g., MQRIC 2025/33990).</li>
                <li>My personal details and the name of my university.</li>
                <li>
                  The official title of my programme: "Bachelor of Science in
                  Nursing".
                </li>
                <li>
                  The crucial evaluation result:
                  <strong>"Comparable to MQF Level 6"</strong>.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This Level 6 rating is the standard for a bachelor's degree and
                is exactly what you need for your professional registration.
              </p>
